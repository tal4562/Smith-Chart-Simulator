## Python GUI for impedance matching with the Smith chart

This project uses the skrf, matplotlib, numpy, and tkinter libraries to create a GUI that plots on the Smith chart.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to install the following Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install skrf matplotlib numpy
```
This project also requires Tkinter. Some systems do not include it by default, so you may need to install it manually.

A smith chart in the form of a png has also been provided.
